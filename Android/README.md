## Using web TrustBoxes in an Android app

While the TrustBoxes (our widgets that show TrustScore, stars, reviews, etc.) are designed to be used on websites, they work just as well in a native mobile app. Using the [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html) from the webkit SDK, the TrustBox can be used to easily show some Trustpilot data in your app.

In this demo app, a TrustBox Mini Carousel has been implemented. The [fragment_api.xml](https://github.com/trustpilot/demo-trustbox-nativeapps/blob/master/Android/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_api.xml) has been used to lay out the necessary views while the [TrustBoxFragment.java](https://github.com/trustpilot/demo-trustbox-nativeapps/blob/master/Android/app/src/main/java/com/trustpilot/trustboxinnativeapp/TrustBoxFragment.java) has been used to hook it all up.

### Setting up the TrustBox

1. Start by [choosing a TrustBox](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/articles/204123713) and then get the code to implement. There are two parts; a `<script>` tag and a `<div>` tag. 

2. In the `<script>` tag is a URL for the TrustBox bootstrap code. This URL is protocol-relative so it doesn't have a defined http: or https:, it just uses whatever the host website uses. That won't work in a native mobile app, so add https: to the URL: https://widget.trustpilot.com/bootstrap/v5/tp.widget.bootstrap.min.js

3. Load the HTML in the web view using the [loadDataWithBaseURL](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#loadDataWithBaseURL(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)):

```java
// Put the code snippets in variables
String bootstrap = "<!-- TrustBox script --> ... <!-- End Trustbox script -->";
String trustBox = "<!-- TrustBox widget - Mini Carousel --> ... <!-- End TrustBox widget -->";

// Manually enable JavaScript in the web view
webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);

// Load the code snippets in the web view
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL("https://widget.trustpilot.com",
                bootstrap + trustBox,
                "text/html",
                null,
                null);
```

4. Note the first parameter to the loadDataWithBaseURL method. It's the base URL that is used to resolve relative URLs in the view.

5. JavaScript must be manually enabled in the view. If it's not, the TrustBox bootstrap script will not be allowed to execute and the TrustBox can't load.

6. The TrustBox needs to access the network to download the bootstrap script as well as the data to show it. Therefore, the app needs the internet permission (see the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/trustpilot/demo-trustbox-nativeapps/blob/master/Android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) file)

That's it! Now you should have a TrustBox in your app!

## Using our API to customize TrustBoxes

We have a public API that can be used to build custom versions of our TrustBoxes. Essentially the TrustBoxes are built on these APIs. Through the APIs, you can get details about a company on Trustpilot such as their TrustScore, number of reviews, and current star rating. You can also request reviews that can then be displayed in your app.

The demo app uses two endpoints on our API, one to get a business unit ([what's a business unit?](https://developers.trustpilot.com/#BusinessUnit)) with details about star rating, TrustScore, etc, and one to get the latest reviews for that business unit. The business unit the app is using is **trustpilot.com** - the business unit id is hard coded in the API call (in this demo app), and so is the API key.

The demo API call is implemented in the [ApiFragment.java](https://github.com/trustpilot/demo-trustbox-nativeapps/blob/master/Android/app/src/main/java/com/trustpilot/trustboxinnativeapp/ApiFragment.java) file. The API request is a simple HTTP GET request, in this case, using [Volley](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html) - an HTTP library for Android apps. Responses from the API are in JSON which is easily handled in Volley by using the [JsonObjectRequest](https://github.com/google/volley/blob/master/src/main/java/com/android/volley/toolbox/JsonObjectRequest.java) class to send the request.

Once youâ€™ve called the API and deserialized the response data, you unwrap the data and use it in a view. The response object from JsonObjectRequest is a JSONObject that has methods for getting data in the appropriate data type:

```java
// response is of type JSONObject
int stars = response.getInt("stars");
double score = response.getDouble("trustScore");

// getting a child object and then a property on that object
JSONObject reviews = response.getJSONObject("numberOfReviews");
int total = reviews.getInt("total");
```

After unwrapping all the necessary data, all that's left is updating the view to show it.

Sending the Volley JsonObjectRequest takes a bit of code. This demo app's simple approach is not generic or reusable but it's enough for this demonstration.

```java
JsonObjectRequest apiRequest = new JsonObjectRequest(...);

Cache cache = new DiskBasedCache(this.getContext().getCacheDir(), 0);
Network network = new BasicNetwork(new HurlStack());
RequestQueue queue = new RequestQueue(cache, network);
queue.start();
queue.add(apiRequest);
```

### Showing reviews

Getting reviews from the API and showing them is similar to getting business unit data. It's just a matter of requesting a different endpoint. The endpoint to use is [https://api.trustpilot.com/v1/business-units/[BUSINESS_UNIT_ID]/reviews](https://developers.trustpilot.com/business-unit-api#get-a-business-unit%27s-reviews). The reviews endpoint on the API can be filtered in a lot of ways. For example to only return 4- and 5-star reviews, latest 10 reviews, reviews with a specific tag etc.

### Notes & references

To use our APIs you need an API key. You can get this key from your account manager at Trustpilot. Here's an article about [getting started with our APIs](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/articles/207309867).
